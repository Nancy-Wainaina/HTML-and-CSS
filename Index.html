  <h1>My First Week At Akirachix Campus</h1>
  <p>I enjoyed how we were welcomed at the campus by the Alumni.<br/>The rooms were very neat and tidy from the first impression.<br/>I have been enjoying the meals from the first day.<br/>The classes have been very interesting because I am getting to learn new things.<br/>Interacting with the Alumni's in our classes have been the best part because we are getting to learn from them.<br/>We have also been introduced to our mentors and this has been the best thing.</p>
